Supplemental Movie 1 demonstrates the skyrmion motion in the monolayer neuron device for the square pulse
with current density J=10 MA/cm^2.

Supplemental Movie 2 demonstrates the skyrmion motion in the monolayer neuron device for the square pulse
with current density J=20 MA/cm^2.

Supplemental Movie 3 demonstrates the skyrmion motion in the monolayer neuron device for the square pulse
with current density J=30 MA/cm^2.

Supplemental Movie 4 demonstrates the skyrmion motion in the bilayer neuron device for the square pulse with
current density J=30 MA/cm^2 alongwith a reset current density of J=âˆ’60 MA/cm^2.

Supplemental Movie 5 demonstrates the skyrmion motion in the bilayer neuron device for the irregular square
pulses.

Supplemental Movie 6 demonstrates the skyrmion motion in the bilayer neuron device for the biologically similar
pulses.

Supplemental Movie 7 demonstrates the motion of the skyrmions in the bilayer synapse device for LTP and LTD
operations. Pulses are shown in normalized scale.
